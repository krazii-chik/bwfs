          The declaration only indicates to the browser that you will use HTML in the document, but it doesn't actually add any HTML structure or content.
        </p>

        <p>
          To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing [html] tags.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anything between the opening [html] and closing [/html] tags will be interpreted as HTML code. Without these tags, it's possible that browsers could incorrectly interpret your HTML code.
