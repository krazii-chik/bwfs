            HTML documents are organized as a collection of parent-child relationships. When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element. The child element is said to be nested inside of the parent element.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since there can be multiple levels of nesting, this analogy can be extended to grandchildren, great-grandchildren and beyond.
        </p>

        <p>
            Understanding this hierarchy is important, because child elements can inherit attributes from their parent element.
