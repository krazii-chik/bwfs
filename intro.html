        <h2>Hypertext Markup Language</h2>

        <p>
          A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text. Markup languages work by surrounding raw text with information the computer can interpret, "marking it up" to be processed.
        </p>

        <p>
          HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, aka “hyperlinks.”
        </p>

        <p>
          With HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements. These elements are (usually) nested inside one another, with each containing information about the type and structure of the information to be displayed in the browser.
        </p>

        <p>
           The minimum amount of HTML code required to successfully structure a web page is sometimes referred to as "boilerplate code."
