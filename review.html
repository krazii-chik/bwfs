          Congratulations on completing the first lesson of HTML & CSS! Let's review what you've learned so far:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Single-closing tags cannot enclose raw text or other elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: <!-- comment -->. [!-- comment -->]
          </li>
          <li>
            HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <!DOCTYPE html> [!DOCTYPE html] declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <html> [html] element will contain all of your HTML code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head> [head] of the page.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> [title] element, inside of the head.
          </li>
          <li>
            A webpage's title appears in a browser's tab.
          </li>
          <li>
            Code for visible HTML content is placed inside of the <body> [body] element.
          </li>
        </ol>
          <p>
            What you've learned in this lesson constitutes the required setup for all HTML files.
          </p>
      </div>
    </body>
  </html>
