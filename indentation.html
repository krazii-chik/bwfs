          The second tool web developers use to make the structure of code easier to read is indentation.

        <p>
            The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, is responsible for maintaining the style standards of HTML. At the time of writing, the W3C recommends 2 spaces of indentation when writing HTML code. Although your code will work without exactly two spaces, this standard is followed by the majority of professional web developers. Indentation is used to easily visualize which elements are nested within other elements.

             The browser ignores whitespace in HTML files when it renders a web page, so it can be used as a tool to make code easier to read and follow.
