          By starting your document with a document type declaration, you let web browsers know that you are using HTML. This declaration is an instruction, telling the browser what type of document to expect and what version of HTML is being used.
        </p>

        <p>
          [!DOCTYPE html] must be the first line of code in all of your HTML documents. If not, your HTML code will likely still work, however, it's risky.
        </p>

        <p>
          For now, the browser will correctly assume that the html in [!DOCTYPE html] is referring to HTML5, as it is the current standard.
