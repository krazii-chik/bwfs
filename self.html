          Self-closing elements contain all the information the browser needs to render the element inside a single tag. Also, because they are single tags, they cannot wrap around raw text or other elements.
        </p>

        <p>
          The line break element [br /] is one example of a self-closing tag. You can use it anywhere within your HTML code. The result is a line break in the browser.
