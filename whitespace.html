            As the code in an HTML file grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of how elements are related. Programmers use two tools to visualize the relationship between elements: whitespace and indentation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Both tools take advantage of the fact that the position of elements in a browser is independent of the amount of whitespace or indentation in the index.html file.
        </p>

        <p>
             The browser ignores whitespace in HTML files when it renders a web page, so it can be used as a tool to make code easier to read and follow.
